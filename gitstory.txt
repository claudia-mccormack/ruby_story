Once there was a parrot who did not like pirates.

He found piracy unethical.

When the pirate ship was in port, the parrot flew into a tavern.

The parrot made friends with the tavern piano player. The piano player named the parrot Jonathan.

Jonathan lived with the piano player for many years, and sang to all the customers at the bar.
